            <h1>Explanation</h1>
            <legend><h2> INDEX PAGE</h2> </legend>
            <details> The index page draws inspiration from the mini homepage websites that were popular in the early 2000s. These personal webpages were often used to introduce oneself, share creative content, and promote ideas or interests in a playful, DIY aesthetic. For this time-traveler project, I reimagined that nostalgic format by designing a digital diary that serves as a gateway to three different decades. The main page features interactive buttons that transport the viewer to immersive, era-specific websites—each one uniquely styled to reflect the cultural and visual trends of the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. </details>
            <br> <br> 
            <legend><h2> 1990s </h2> </legend>
            <details> The 1990s-themed website is inspired by NASA’s homepage design from 1994–1997. Embracing its minimalist aesthetic, the site features a simple layout with a main image, background color, and logo, free of decorative elements. I used a table to neatly organize content from Hito Steyerl’s article In Defense of the Poor Image, and added a small interactive “opening box” game that reveals a trophy and a link to the original article. To enhance the retro feel, I included a classic-style footer with underlined blue URL links, reminiscent of early web design.
            </details>
            <br> <br> 
            <legend><h2> 2000s </h2> </legend>
            <details> The 2000s-themed website draws inspiration from the vibrant, playful aesthetics of Y2K pink culture—rooted in retro fashion and early web design. To capture this energy, I incorporated fun animations and a pixelated Mario character that bounces around the page and links to the original article. The content is divided into small, digestible sections within a soft pink container, creating a dynamic and nostalgic browsing experience.
            </details>
            <br> <br> 
            <legend><h2> 2010s </h2> </legend>
            <details> TThe 2010s-themed website takes inspiration from contemporary magazine layouts, which often use structured grids and modular cubes to create visually compelling yet highly readable designs. In my version, content is revealed through interactive hover effects—users can explore by hovering over preview images that capture their interest, encouraging a more engaged and intuitive browsing experience. This design choice reflects the editorial style of the decade, where bold visuals and layered content enhance storytelling. To further enrich the site, I incorporated subtle animations into the navigation and title to guide the user's eye and add a dynamic, polished feel.
